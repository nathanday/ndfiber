This will work
try
{
	exception throwing code
}
catch(...)
{
	...
}
[NDFiber yieldToFiber:a]

But this will NOT work
try
{
	[NDFiber yieldToFiber:a]
	exception throwing code
}
catch(...)
{
	...
}

â€¢ autorelease pools: autorelease pools work fine as long as you realise that after a yield any autoreleased object may have been released by an autorelease pool in the other fiber. You should also stick to only using autorlease pools in one fiber otherwise you can end up trying to release autorelease pools out of order, releasing autorelease pools out of order seems to work but it definitely goes against apples documentation on autorelease pools

For example this can fail

	id	theObject = [obj autoreleasedObject];
	[NDFiber yieldToFiber:a]
	[theObject doSomething];		// object may longer be a valid object


The fix is to retain the object and release it after the yield

	id	theObject = [obj autoreleasedObject];
	[theObject retain];
	[NDFiber yieldToFiber:a]
	[theObject doSomething];
	[theObject release];
