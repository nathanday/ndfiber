Limitations
-----------

¥ throwing exception: exceptions when thrown can unwrap the stack past any fiber yield, you can throw and catch exceptions before a yield. For example

This will work
try
{
	exception throwing code
}
catch(...)
{
}
[NDFiber yieldToBiber:a]

But this will NOT work
try
{
	exception throwing code
	[NDFiber yieldToBiber:a]
}
catch(...)
{
}

¥ autorelease pools: autorelease pools work fine as long as you realise that after a yield any autoreleased object may have been released by a autorelease pool in the other fiber.

For example this may fail

	id	theObject = [obj autoreleasedObject];
	[NDFiber yieldToBiber:a]
	[theObject doSomething];		// object may longer be valid


The fix is to retain the object an release it after the yield

	id	theObject = [obj autoreleasedObject];
	[theObject retain];
	[NDFiber yieldToBiber:a]
	[theObject doSomething];
	[theObject release];
