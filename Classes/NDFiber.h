	@abstract Fiber are co-operative multitasking threads.
	@discussion Unlike modern threads that depends on the kernel's thread scheduler to preempt a busy thread and resume another thread; fibers yield themselves to run another fiber while executing. Fibers are much easier to program than threads as by controlling when a fiber yields you can avoid race conditions, but this is at the expense of parallel execution on multiple cores.
